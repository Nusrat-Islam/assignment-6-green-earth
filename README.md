#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?


1.

 Var:
     * Function scoped
     * Can be redeclared and update
 let:
    * Block-scoped
    * Can be updated but cannot redeclared in   the same. 
 const:
     * Block-scoped
     * Can be updated but cannot be redeclared in the same scope   

2.
  
map():
     * Returns undefined and cannot returns new array

forEach():
    * Returns New array
   

 filter():
      * Returns new array
       
 3.
   Arrow functions are shorter syntax for writing functions.

 4.
  Destructring allows to extract values from arrays or objjects into variabls easily

  Array object:
   const num = [1,2,4,3];
   cons[a,b,c,d] = num;
   console.log(a,b,c,d) //answer:1 2 3 4  

5.
   * template literals are cleaner and      more      readable
   * No need for + for concatanation
   * Can include expressions directly.
